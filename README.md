# T&K Nigerian Restaurant - A Taste of Africa!
T&K Restaurant is one of Portland's finest Nigerian cuisines spots in the city. TJ and Kenny who are the founders of T&K Restaurant, I worked with both these gentlemen to see how I could bring their business vision to life in a digital format. <a href="https://tandkpdx.com/">Click here </a> to check out their menu but warning, I wouldn't recommend it on an empty stomach!

<b>Technologies & Tools Utilized:</b> JavaScript, Boostrap, HTML & CSS.</b> This particular project was developed for a client of mines. After drawing up multiple designs they went with this because of it's modern look and subtle hints of style that higlights culture.

- I approached the website with front end web structure patterns such as seperations of concerns. 
- I've structured my HTML using semantic tags for better accesibility for a broad range of users.
- I leveraged a mixture of CSS and Bootstrap to make a fluid UI.
- I linked the `Order Online` button in the navigation to their DoorDash page for easy access for online delivery.
- Integrated Swiper.js to assist in creating fast and fluid slider components for customer reviews.

## Features
- Mobile, Desktop, iPad, Tablets & other device types friendly.

## Lessons Learned
- This project was a great one, mainly because the things I learned the most was not from writing code. From this experience I was able to sharpen my interpersonal skills, negiotating, working with clients and deadlines. As a freelancer this was a great opportunity for me to exercise my communication and soft skills which ended up giving me and the clients both a great experience throughout the process.

## Future Optimizations:
- Refactor with a JavaScript framework.
- Implement lazy loading for images and faster load speed.
- Combine script files to increase load speed and reduce frequent http request.
