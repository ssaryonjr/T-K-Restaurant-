# T&K Nigerian Restaurant - A Taste of Africa!
T&K Restaurant is one of Portland's finest Nigerian cuisines spots in the city. Owned by TJ and Kenny, I worked with both these gentlemen to see how I could bring their business vision to life in a digital format. <a href="https://tandkpdx.com/">Click here </a> to check out their menu but warning, I wouldn't recommend it on an empty stomach!

<b>Technologies & Tools Utilized:</b> JavaScript, OMDb API, Swiper.js, HTML & CSS.</b> This project was inspired directly from popular streaming platforms such as Netflix. This project highlights the use of working with third party API's to dynamically change the user interface with JavaScript.

- I was able to implement new HTML5 features such as videos to give the user interface a more dynamimc view and went with the more semantic approach of using HTML elements to give more users a better experience and accessibility.
- With just regular CSS I was able to create responsive layouts that looks well on every device.
- On the JavaScript side I took advantage of asynchronous programming and promises to retrieve data from the OMDb API.

## Features
- Mobile, Desktop, iPad, Tablets & other device type friendly.

## Lessons Learned
- This was another fun project I built that taught me a deeper understanding into the fundamentals of vanilla JavaScript, asynchronous programming, promises and third party API's. This was great practice at working with other developers code, integrating it into my own and reading up on documentation and best practices.  

## Future Optimizations:
- Refactor in React.
- Use local storage to allow users to star their favorite movies and show it in a different navigation page.
- Implement lazy loading for images.
